    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to grow our cutomer base. The site will be another place for potential customers to receive information about our rafting services, as well as a place to book trips. It will also serve to give customers information to connect to our customer service  representatives through phone and email.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is younger to middle age adults who are physically active adventure-seekers. They will generally be financially stable and able to spend for the thrill-seeking activities our company provides. We seek to provide an easy introduction point to white water rafting by providing all the gear, training, and team leaders so no previous experience is required for a safe experience. This site will be accessed through all types of devices, but we anticipate mobile users will be the majority.</p>

      The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Expeditions
      offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
      Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
      Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

      Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
      physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
      adventures you are seeking, White Water Expeditions can make it
      happen for you.
