        <h2>Zachariah Sutherland ðŸ˜Š </h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Zach. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software/web development and am very excited to start this course with everyone. I work 2 jobs and am usually busy but in my spare time I like board games, playing sports (pickleball is my new favorite), hiking/canoeing, spending time with my girlfriend and other friends, and probably other things that don't come right to mind.</p>
        <p> So far I've really enjoyed the challenge and logical nature of back-end programming and am excited to learn more about the web design side of things.</p>
