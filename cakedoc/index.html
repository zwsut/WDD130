        <h1 id="mainheadline">Hello and welcome to Cake Doctor!</h1>

        <div id="bottombanner">
            <p>My name is Zach and I’m excited to bring you detailed recipes for delicious cakes. Every recipe hosted on the site will be personally chosen recipes that are proven to be crowd pleasers. Right now, to launch the site, we are going to be providing recipes for two personal favorites of mine. First is a traditional tres leches cake that is light, delicate, and melts in your mouth. The second is a classic rich chocolate cake, with raspberry buttercream frosting and dark chocolate ganache dripped over the top. Each recipe will give you step by step directions so anyone can easily follow along and create these cakes. We will be adding more recipes as we grow and look forward to bringing you our most creative and delicious cakes going forward. We hope you will join us!</p>

            <p>A little bit about me. I’m from Connecticut in the United States. I’ve always been passionate about cooking and baking but hadn’t made many cakes until early in 2023. My interest started when making my partner’s birthday cake and realizing how creative you can be when designing cakes. I also realized how much it can show someone how you feel about them. Since then, I’ve been baking cakes more and more and delving further into the possibilities of the craft. I anticipate continuing to discover new and delicious ways to bake and decorate cakes as I grow and learn.</p>
