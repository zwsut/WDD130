        Hello and welcome to Cake Doctor!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Zach and I’m excited to bring you detailed recipes for delicious cakes. Every recipe hosted on the site will be personally chosen recipes that are proven to be crowd pleasers. Right now, to launch the site, we are going to be providing recipes for two personal favorites of mine. First is a traditional tres leches cake that is light, delicate, and melts in your mouth. The second is a classic rich chocolate cake, with raspberry buttercream frosting and dark chocolate ganache dripped over the top. Each recipe will give you step by step directions so anyone can easily follow along and create these cakes. We will be adding more recipes as we grow and look forward to bringing you our most creative and delicious cakes going forward. We hope you will join us!

      <p>A little bit about the site creator.</p>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Zach and I’m from Connecticut in the United States. I’ve always been passionate about cooking and baking but hadn’t made many cakes until early in 2023. My interest started when making my partner’s birthday cake and realizing how creative you can be when designing cakes. I also realized how much it can show someone how you feel about them. Since then -, I’ve been baking cakes more and more and delving further into the possibilities of the craft. I anticipate continuing to discover new and delicious ways to bake and decorate cakes as I grow and learn.</p>
      <p>Additionally on the home page, I will link the recipe pages with pictures of the cakes. Pictures used below are placeholders, as I expect to be using personally taken photos of the cakes once they are made.</p>

      <h3>Tres Leches</h3>
      <p>
        Tres leches cake is a light, airy cake,  similar to angel food cake which is soaked in a three-milk mixture. In our recipe this will be left overnight to soak but the exact amount of time is up to you. This cake is then covered in a whipped cream topping and spices. This is a traditional Mexican recipe and is a favorite for us for birthdays and special occasions.

      </ul>
      <h3>Chocolate Raspberry</h3>
      <p>
        This is a very rich, dark chocolate cake created with dedicated chocolate lovers in mind. The cake itself is ultra-rich, using multiple types of cocoa, including dutch-process cocoa, and coffee to create a deep, intense flavor. This is enhanced with a lightly raspberry flavored buttercream frosting lightly spread over and between the layers, followed by a dark chocolate ganache dripped over the top to add more chocolate intensity. A chocolate whipped cream is used to top the cake and add a little lightness.
